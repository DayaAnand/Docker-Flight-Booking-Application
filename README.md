# Docker-Flight-Booking-Application

This repository contains a Docker Application with three containers for a simple Flight Booking System.

Front-end Container - ReactJS
Runtime Container   - NodeJS
Database Container  - MongoDB

In this application, the users can book a ticket from the list of all fligts shown and can also view their bookings.

I have also included **commands.txt** which has all the neccesary commands that will help you out in building the Docker Application.
The pdf file may also help you..!!
